# Atelier Ten Temperature Heatmap

This project uses  Kieran Timberlake Pointelist temperature sensors to create a heatmap over the A10 floorplan. It uses Bootstrap under the Django framework to create visualizations

## TODO: ##
This is a work in progress. Things to do include:
* Navigating the API to gather relevant data for heatmaps
* Setting temperature zones in CSS (dynamically)
* Adding a chart below floorplan to show all sensors together (in last X measurements)
